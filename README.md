# Grand Mastermind

## description
A toy prototype for a Grand Mastermind (Colors and Shapes) game, with a Prolog-CLP solver to play, and a Vue.js GUI.

I'm befinner in Vue.js, and the GUI is ufinished, but useable.

The solver in prolog can be used via a REST/JSON API

To improve.

## usage

launche the `run-server.bat` and connecte to http://localhost:8080
choose your game mode, attack (you helped by prolog try to find the code) or defence (prolog try to guess the code you set)...

## Displaimer
I'm a beginner in Vue.js, and javascript frameworks.

I'm a beginner in Prolog too, but it is more my domain.

It's basically a toy, for learning and teaching.

## Credits
thanks to Claude and SWI Prolog documentation.
Thanks to CHiP teams in the old time when I discolered CLP.
